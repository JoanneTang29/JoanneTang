# Chain Reaction Game

My application is based on a game show where players compete to guess words in a collection of two-word phrases. Two players compete to guess words that relate to the word above and/or below in some way. Each word is part of a two-word term. The goal is to get the highest score by wagering points and guessing words correctly.

## Technologies used:

- HTML: Structure the game layout and its content
- CSS: Style the game and layout to make it more attractive and engaging
- Javascript: Create a dynamic and interactive game

## Approach taken:

- Create a wireframe to have an idea of what the game will look like.
- Create an HTML file to make a similar layout to the wireframe and make adjustments as needed.
- Create a CSS file to style the game.
- Use Javascript to declare variables and create functions to make the application interactive.
- Create a nested array of 5-word phrases to randomize for the game.
- Create various functions like: add/subtract points from the score, alternate players, guess missing words, check for the winner, toggle the rules, reset the game, clear the board for the next round, etc.

## Nice-to-haves:

- A clear way to show that points are being added or subtracted.
- Make the game not case-sensitive.
