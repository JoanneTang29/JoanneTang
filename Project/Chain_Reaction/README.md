# Chain Reaction Game

My application is based on a game show where players compete to guess words in a collection of two-word phrases. Two players compete to guess words that relate to the word above and/or below in some way. Each word is part of a two-word term. The goal is to get the highest score by wagering points and guessing words correctly.

## Technologies used:

HTML: Structure the game layout and its content
CSS: Style the game and layout to make it more attractive and engaging
Javascript: Create a dynamic and interactive game

## Approach taken:

Create a wireframe to have an idea what the game will look like.
Create an HTML file to make a similar layout to the wireframe and make adjustments as needed.
Create a CSS file to style the game similar to the wireframe.
Use Javascript to declare variables and create functions to make the application interactive.
Created an array of words and nested it to create a collection of 5-word arrays.
Figure out how to select each nested array as well as randomize it.
Then figure out how to insert the array into the HTML.
There are functions to add and subtract points from the score, alternate players, guess missing words, check for the winner, toggle the rules, reset the game, clear the board for the next round.

## Nice-to-haves:

A clear way to show that points are being added or subtracted.
Make the game not case-sensitive.
